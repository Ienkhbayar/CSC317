Building the Budget Planner App taught me lots of things about being a software developer. We worked on this as a group and I was responsible for building *Full-Stack Features*—CRUD operations and input validation (both client- and server-side).

However, working in a group of first-timers meant none of us had much full-stack experience, so it was really difficult. I finished my part, but it broke after my teammates updated the code, so I had to fill in the gaps where needed. I ended up working on almost every part of the app.

Connecting my teammates’ front-end work to my backend was challenging—bugs kept surfacing, and I often had to retrace and fix broken code after their updates. We relied on clear communication and held Zoom meetings to debug together. Through lots of debugging sessions, our app finally went live. It may not be 100% perfect, but the core features are fully functional.

This project demanded a lot of dedication and gave me firsthand experience of what it means to be a software developer. I broadened my coding skills and learned to use tools like Render, Postman, and MongoDB. Finally, embedding the live application into my personal portfolio let me bring together responsive design, theming, version control, and deployment skills. From HTML/CSS basics to a fully deployed full-stack project, this final step ties together everything I’ve learned this semester.
