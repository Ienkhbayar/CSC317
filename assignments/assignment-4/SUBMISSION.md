### ðŸ“– Implementation Summary

This project introduced me to JavaScript programming through three integrated parts.  
In Part 0, I installed Node.js and created a small script using ES6+ features like template literals and arrow functions.  
In Part 1, I developed a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It supports arithmetic operations, decimal input, percentage, and error-safe evaluation. 
Itâ€™s designed after the iOS calculator layout for an easy to use experience.  

I also added full keyboard support with visual feedback for accessibility.  
In Part 2, I integrated the calculator into my personal portfolio, complete with a project card, dual-theme screenshot preview, navigation link, and clean structure.

### âš¡ Challenges & How I Solved Them

- **GitHub Pages 404 Error:**  
  Initially, my site wouldnâ€™t deploy correctly. I fixed the issue by ensuring the deployment path included `/assignments/assignment-4/` and correcting all relative file paths.

- **Keyboard Support:**  
  Mapping keys to the calculator and handling special keys like `Enter`, `Backspace`, and `Escape` required debugging, DOM testing, and use of a keymap + `addEventListener`.

### âœ¨ Bonus Features Implemented

- **Theme Switcher (Portfolio + Calculator):**  
  I implemented a theme toggle system for both the calculator and the portfolio using separate CSS files (`calculator-dark.css`, `calculator-light.css`).  
  Users can switch between dark and light themes, and preferences are saved with `localStorage`.

- **Keyboard Support with Visual Feedback:**  
  Users can interact with the calculator using the keyboard.  
  Keypresses are mapped to buttons and trigger a flash animation for better UX.
